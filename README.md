## Running Project

To clone the project, run:

	git clone https://github.com/kraritt/Xolver && cd Xolver

The code for running GSM, AIME, MATH and LiveCodeBench tasks may be found in the following subfolders

* ./gsm/ contains code for running GSM
* ./aime/ contains code for running AIME
* ./math/ contains code for running MATH
* ./lcb/ contains code for running LiveCodeBench results

To prepare a new conda or python virtual environment, run:
	`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**GSM:**

To generate and evaluated answer for GSM problems through Xolver, run:
	`python gsm/gsm.py`

You can download the GSM dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k)

 **AIME:**

To generate and evaluated answer for AIME problems through Xolver, run:
	`python aime/aime.py`

You can download the AIME datasets [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/aime_2024) and [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yentinglin/aime_2025) 

**MATH:**

To generate and evaluated answer for MATH problems through Xolver, run:
	`python math/math.py`

 You can download the MATH dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/di-zhang-fdu/MATH500)

 **LiveCodeBench:**

To generate and evaluated answer for LiveCodeBench problems through Xolver, run:
	`python lcb/lcb.py`

 You can download the LiveCodeBench dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livecodebench/code_generation)
